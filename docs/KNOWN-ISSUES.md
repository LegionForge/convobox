## WASAPI output plays speech an octave too high ("static chipmunk")

**Status:** deferred (2026-07-12). Mitigation: use an **MME** output device.
WASAPI is documented as low-latency-but-finicky in
`scripts/audio_devices.py` and `docs/DESIGN-echo-and-barge-in.md`.

**Symptom.** With a WASAPI output device pinned (e.g.
`Headphones (Realtek(R) Audio), Windows WASAPI`), TTS playback is pitched up
about an octave with a static/gargle over it. The tester's exact
description across three UAT runs: *"the speech frequency is doubled but the
speech rate is right"* — i.e. **pitch up an octave, tempo correct.** MME and
DirectSound outputs on the same machine are clean.

**Two distinct causes — one fixed, one not.**

1. **Static at the seams — FIXED** (streaming resampler, this same work).
   Streaming playback resampled each TTS chunk in isolation, injecting a
   phase discontinuity at every chunk boundary. Inaudible at an integer
   device ratio (22050→44100, MME) but clicking at a non-integer ratio
   (22050→48000, any 48 kHz WASAPI device). Fixed by `_StreamResampler`
   (`src/convobox/audio/playback.py`): per-chunk RMS error vs a whole-buffer
   resample dropped from 0.024 to ~0 at 48000. This removed the *clicky*
   component but not the octave shift.

2. **Octave-up pitch — NOT FIXED.** Tempo-correct + pitch-doubled is the
   textbook signature of **mono audio mishandled on a stereo device** at the
   channel layer, inside PortAudio's WASAPI shared-mode conversion — below
   ConvoBox's Python. The player opens the stream `channels=1` and writes a
   mono buffer; the Realtek WASAPI endpoint's shared mix format is stereo
   48 kHz, and PortAudio's mono→stereo path appears to reinterpret rather
   than duplicate the samples on this driver.

**Evidence.**
- Offline frame-count tests show playback writes the *correct* number of
  frames at 48000 (implied duration == true duration), so it is **not** a
  sample-rate/resampling error — those change tempo, which is correct here.
- `AudioPlayer.play()` and `play_stream()` both produce correct-duration
  output numerically; the corruption is only audible from the physical DAC.
- Could not auto-measure the emitted pitch: this sounddevice build's
  `sd.WasapiSettings` has no `loopback` kwarg, so WASAPI loopback capture
  (which would confirm 440 Hz → ~880 Hz) is unavailable here. Diagnosis
  rests on the tempo-correct-pitch-doubled acoustic signature.

**Candidate fix (untried).** Open the output stream at the device's **native
channel count** and upmix mono→N ourselves (duplicate the sample across
channels) instead of relying on PortAudio's WASAPI mono conversion. Care
required: the AEC far-end reference (`AudioPlayer.on_block_played`) must stay
**mono** at the device rate — feed the canceller the pre-upmix mono block,
not the interleaved stereo one. Verify with the tester's ear (or a working
loopback capture) before trusting it, since the last three WASAPI fixes each
looked right offline and still needed a live listen.

**Why deferred.** MME output works cleanly today and 183 ms of output
latency is fine for the prototype. WASAPI's ~22 ms is an optimization, not a
blocker, and the fix touches the playback core plus the AEC reference — worth
doing carefully, not rushing mid-UAT.
